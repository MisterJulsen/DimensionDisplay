# Minecraft Dimension Display Datapack
This is a small datapack that shows the dimension each player is in in the tab list. In addition, the data pack contains a extensive AFK tracker and a LIVE mode for streamers or YouTubers. Whether a player is AFK or Live this is then also shown in the tab list.
## Download
To download the datapack, click on "Code" and then on "Download ZIP" to download this branch.
## Supported versions
The datapack was originally developed for `1.18.2`, but also works in all newer versions. However, the `pack_format` in `pack.mcmeta` may need to be adjusted accordingly. You can find a list of Datapack formats [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format).
## How to install
After downloading the ZIP file, open it and simply drag and drop the folder inside your ZIP file into your `datapacks` directory in your world directory.
## How to use
After reloading your world the datapack will workon it's own in the background with no further setup required. If you want to toggle the LIVE mode, simply run `/trigger live`.
